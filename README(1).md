# EMOTION DETECTION FROM TEXT

The project utilizes the "tweet_emotions" dataset, comprising tweets annotated with emotion labels, to train and evaluate the model's ability to recognize emotions in short textual expressions. This dataset, containing 40,000 tweets with 13 emotion classes, is crucial for training the model effectively. The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, facilitating efficient manipulation. To enhance model robustness, diverse datasets, including one from Kaggle, are considered for fine-tuning and evaluation.


# CONTENT
The dataset comprises tweets annotated with corresponding emotions, featuring three key columns: tweet_id, sentiment, and content. The content column contains the raw tweet, while sentiment indicates the emotion associated with each tweet. Refer to the provided starter notebook for deeper insights into the dataset.
