# EMOTION DETECTION FROM TEXT

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
Emotion detection from text poses a significant challenge in Natural Language Processing, primarily due to the scarcity of labeled datasets and the inherently multi-class nature of the problem. The diverse range of human emotions makes it challenging to amass a sufficiently balanced dataset, often resulting in class imbalance issues. Fortunately, this project addresses these challenges by leveraging a labeled dataset for emotion detection

# CONTENT
The dataset comprises tweets annotated with corresponding emotions, featuring three key columns: tweet_id, sentiment, and content. The content column contains the raw tweet, while sentiment indicates the emotion associated with each tweet. Refer to the provided starter notebook for deeper insights into the dataset.
